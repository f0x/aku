1.0 plan:

/ StatusBar Message of ending extraction
/ Check overwrite
? Port akuViewer to KParts (?? troubles in handling a non-existing file ?? maybe akuViewer is better)
- Sum of packed size in meta
- Where possible use QHBoxLayout and QVBoxLayout in place of QGridLayout
- Check overwritedialog's resize policy
- Check overwritedialog's reactivity slowness
? Make restriction handling in a separate thread
? Check wait cursor
? Reopening an archive is slooooow
/ fix percentage parsing
/ issue when reloading archive after encryption
? "Encrypt this archive" -> "Encrypt this archive's header" (a note explains already what is going to happen)
/ Adding files to header protected ones does not work (goes loop)
/ Archive creation doesn't stop
- Sending aku to tray during archive creation still keeps visible the creation dialog
- Erase akuShadeAnimation. REASON: completely unuseful!
- When canceling archive creation: "Archive creation stopped. Do you wish to erase the archive?"
- Set keyboard shortcuts up
- Preview of crypted files does not work
- When pressing cancel in new archive, if the archive opened before doesn't exist anymore should get back to a clean list.
- Global progressBar seems to not work when creating an archive with a custom filled folder
- Deleting an archive with comment still keeps the comment visible after the deletion
- When creating a new archive using as filename an already existing one makes aku looping..
- TEST

next features plan:

- Column ordering, see Dolphin for tips
- Move lots of code from mainwindow to specific classes
- Make comments in english
- Archive creation: dragging many files at same time
- annma dislikes the name
- Clean dragTarget's code
- toLong() to toULong()
- Make const unedited params in functions

SYMBOLS:
?: is the wish really needed? || the bug is not reproducible
/: work in progress (often this is used when the bug/issue was completed and needs some testing before closing it)
-: bug/issue which needs normal level of attention
!: high priority bug/issue/wish
